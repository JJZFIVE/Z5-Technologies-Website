Over the summer of 2022, I slept on my friend's inflatable couch in Miami and worked all day every day on BlockStreet. It's an NFT Marketplace on Ethereum and Polygon with social functionality; zero-code, full collection minting with metadata pinned on IPFS; wallet aggregation and user account creation; and auctions, listings, transfers, burns, and more.

## Features

I can't actually go into that much detail about how I built BlockStreet because it's currently in the process of being sold for a minimum of $4.25 million, but I can tell you about some of the features. BlockStreet offers all of the standard operations
you'd expect on any marketplace – transferring, auctioning, bidding, listing, buying, burning, etc.
It includes the easiest way to launch a collection I've ever seen, which is a huge deal for artists and collectors:
there's no code required, and the metadata is pinned on IPFS. You can make a BlockStreet account with any one of over five
crypto wallets (ex: Metamask) and you can connect as many as you want to that account. You can follow other BlockStreet users
and see their collections and activity on the Instagram-style following feed.
