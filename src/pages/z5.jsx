          Z5 Technologies LLC is registered in Delaware and is my personal brand
          and company. Every personal project that I build, I build under the Z5
          Technologies brand. I do this primarily for legal protection, but also
          to help me build a brand that I can use to build a business around in
          the future. More to come here soon.
